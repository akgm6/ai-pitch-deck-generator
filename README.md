## Local Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repositories

### Frontend
git clone https://github.com/akgm6/ai-pitch-deck-generator/frontend.git

cd frontend

npm install


### Backend
git clone https://github.com/akgm6/ai-pitch-deck-generator/backend.git

cd -backend

npm install


## 2. Configure Environment Variables (optional)
You can add your own Gemini API key in .env files for both the frontend and backend.

Example for the backend:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key

*I'm currently mocking the Gemini API since quota or access issues arise.*


## 3. Run Locally
### Frontend
npm run dev

### Backend
npm run start:dev


## Known Issues
- Backend cold start delays may affect reliability
- Gemini API quotas or key issues may block live slide generation
- Fallback to local server testing is advised in cases of deployment failure
- Export features may occasionally fail due to browser compatibility or size limitations


## Project Status
This submission reflects the current completed version of SlideGenius. While deployment challenges remain unresolved, the core functionality, design system, and export capabilities are fully implemented and available in both development and hosted environments.
